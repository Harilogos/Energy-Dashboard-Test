## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Secrets
Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN          # Automatically provided by GitHub
PRESCINTO_API_TOKEN   # Your Prescinto API token (if using external API)
```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Set up GitHub Environments for deployment:

**Staging Environment:**
- Protection rules: None (auto-deploy)
- Environment secrets: Staging-specific configurations

**Production Environment:**
- Protection rules: Required reviewers
- Environment secrets: Production configurations

### 3. Branch Protection Rules
Configure branch protection for `main` and `develop`:
- Require status checks to pass
- Require branches to be up to date
- Require review from code owners
- Restrict pushes to specific people/teams

```bash
gh workflow run release.yml -f version=v1.2.0 -f environment=production
```

### Monitoring Workflow Status

**Check Workflow Runs:**
```bash
gh run list --workflow=ci.yml
```

**View Workflow Details:**
```bash
gh run view [RUN_ID]
```

**Download Artifacts:**
```bash
gh run download [RUN_ID]
```

## üìà Metrics and Reporting

### Test Coverage

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Test Failures:**
1. Check test logs in workflow artifacts
2. Run tests locally: `python tests/test_runner.py --all`
3. Verify dependencies: `python tests/test_validation.py`

**Docker Build Failures:**
1. Check Dockerfile syntax
2. Verify base image availability
3. Review build logs for dependency issues

**Deployment Failures:**
1. Check environment configuration
2. Verify secrets and permissions
3. Review deployment logs

**Performance Regressions:**
1. Compare benchmark results with baseline
2. Identify performance bottlenecks
3. Optimize critical code paths

### Debug Commands

**Local Testing:**
```bash
# Run all tests locally
python tests/test_runner.py --all --verbose

# Run specific test category
python tests/test_runner.py --unit --coverage

# Validate test setup
python tests/test_validation.py

# Run with Docker
docker-compose --profile testing up test
```

**Security Scanning:**
```bash
# Run security scans locally
docker-compose --profile security up security-scan

# Manual security checks
safety check
bandit -r backend/ frontend/ src/
```

## üìö Best Practices

### Workflow Optimization
1. **Cache Dependencies:** Use GitHub Actions cache for pip dependencies
2. **Parallel Execution:** Run independent jobs in parallel
3. **Conditional Execution:** Use conditions to skip unnecessary jobs
4. **Artifact Management:** Clean up old artifacts regularly

### Security Best Practices
1. **Secret Management:** Use GitHub secrets for sensitive data
2. **Least Privilege:** Grant minimum required permissions
3. **Regular Updates:** Keep actions and dependencies updated
4. **Audit Logs:** Monitor workflow execution logs

### Performance Optimization
1. **Resource Limits:** Set appropriate resource limits for jobs
2. **Timeout Configuration:** Configure reasonable timeouts
3. **Efficient Testing:** Optimize test execution time
4. **Selective Testing:** Run relevant tests based on changes

## üîÑ Maintenance
